# K9s for Warriors Kennel Management Software
## A [Code on the Beach](http://www.codeonthebeach.com) 2013 Hackathon Project

This project is a collaboration between Code on the Beach volunteers and K9s for Warriors 
to produce a working kennel management website for keeping track of the dogs in their system.

[K9s for Warriors](http://www.k9sforwarriors.org) provides dogs rescued from shelters and service K9s to our military troops
and veterans suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).

At Code on the Beach 2013, over 20 attendees worked late into the night on Friday and Saturday night of 
the conference to produce this website for K9s for Warriors. After the conference, a group of volunteers
has been working to finish the project for them. We at Code on the Beach are excited to help such a great
local organization and show support for our troops.
